/**
 * Implements policies and bookkeeping for sharing an adjustable-sized pool of memory between tasks.
 *
 * Tries to ensure that each task gets a reasonable share of memory, instead of some task ramping up
 * to a large amount first and then causing others to spill to disk repeatedly.
 *
 * If there are N tasks, it ensures that each task can acquire at least 1 / 2N of the memory
 * before it has to spill, and at most 1 / N. Because N varies dynamically, we keep track of the
 * set of active tasks and redo the calculations of 1 / 2N and 1 / N in waiting tasks whenever this
 * set changes. This is all done by synchronizing access to mutable state and using wait() and
 * notifyAll() to signal changes to callers. Prior to Spark 1.6, this arbitration of memory across
 * tasks was performed by the ShuffleMemoryManager.
 *
 * 为任务之间共享可调整大小的内存池制定策略和簿记。
 * 尽量确保每个任务都能获得合理的内存份额，而不是某些任务先获得大量内存，然后导致其他任务反复溢出到磁盘。
 * 由于 N 是动态变化的，我们会跟踪活动任务集，并在任务集发生变化时重新计算等待任务中的 1 / 2N 和 1 / N。
 * 所有这些都是通过同步访问可变状态以及使用 wait() 和 notifyAll() 向调用者发送更改信号来完成的。在 Spark 1.6 之前，这种跨任务的内存仲裁由 ShuffleMemoryManager 执行。
 *
 * @param lock a [[MemoryManager]] instance to synchronize on
 * @param memoryMode the type of memory tracked by this pool (on- or off-heap)
