/**
 * A class for writing JVM objects directly to a file on disk. This class allows data to be appended
 * to an existing block. For efficiency, it retains the underlying file channel across
 * multiple commits. This channel is kept open until close() is called. In case of faults,
 * callers should instead close with revertPartialWritesAndClose() to atomically revert the
 * uncommitted partial writes.
 *
 * This class does not support concurrent writes. Also, once the writer has been opened it cannot be
 * reopened again.
 *
 *
 *用于将JVM对象直接写入磁盘上的文件的类。此类允许将数据附加到现有块中。为了提高效率，
 *它保留了跨多个提交的底层文件通道。此通道保持打开状态，直到调用close（）为止。在出现错误的情况下，
 *调用方应改为使用revertPartialWritesAndClose（）关闭，以原子方式还原未提交的部分写入。
 *此类不支持并发写入。此外，一旦写入程序被打开，它就不能再次打开。
